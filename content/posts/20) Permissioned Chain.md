# Notes
After Bitcoin, other coins started popping up- 
1) Litecoin(using its hashing algo) only allowed mining using GPUs or CPUs.
2) Monero(using its hashing algo) only allowed mining using CPUs.
3) Ethereum also introduced something called smart contracts.
## What problems might come up in smart contracts? 
1) If the code is non-deterministic then it'll be a problem.
2) Data of the code must be isolated so each smart contract is run in classes and objects.
3) Infinite loops
